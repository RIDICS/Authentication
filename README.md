# Authentication

The Authentication service is configured primarly for usage in *Vokabulář webový*, so it has some predefined values for this usage.

The Authentication service project is consists of the three important parts:
* Ridics.Authentication.Service - the server app, the authentication service
* Ridics.Authentication.Database.Migrator - the app for creating or updating database schema including data migrations
* Ridics.Authentication.HttpClient - the client for communication with Authentication Service API (NuGet package is generated)

## Development

The configuration for local Development is prepared directly in the solution.

### Required software:
* Microsoft Windows 10
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
  * ASP.NET and web development
  * .NET Core 2.2 SDK
* Yarn
* Git - for restoring Yarn dependencies
* Node.js - for restoring Yarn dependencies
* SQL Server or PostgreSQL 11

### Project initialization

> It is highly recommended to disable NPM and Bower restore in Visual Studio and use Yarn instead of it.

> Development environment is using app setting files with name "LocalDebug", e.g. `appsettings.LocalDebug.json` or `modules.LocalDebug.json`

* Checkout project from git
* Restore Node packages using Yarn (`YarnInstall.ps1` in root folder)
* Open solution in Visual Studio
* Run Ridics.Authentication.Database.Migrator project to create default database for `LocalDebug` environment
* Run Ridics.Authentication.Service to run Authentication Service with `LocalDebug` configuration
* Default username is "Admin" with password "administrator" or "PortalAdmin" (reduced permissions) with password "administrator"

## Deployment

Deployment to Production or Staging server requires creating specific configurations. The app configuration can be placed in `C:\Pool\itjakub-secrets\Auth` and `C:\Pool\itjakub-secrets\DatabaseMigratorAuth` folder on build computer. The configuration is separated to avoid commiting sensitive files to git. The files in this folder are included to publish package during build.

Default deployment script assumes that the Authentication Service will be placed in `Default Web Site/Auth` site, e.g. `https://localhost/Auth`.

* Choose the environment name, e.g. Production
* Create all configuration files for specified environment according to https://github.com/RIDICS/itjakub-secrets
  * e.g. `modules.Production.json` and so on
* Fill correct values to these files

### Required software:
* Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 +
* SQL Server or PostgreSQL 11
* IIS
* .NET Core 2.2 Runtime & Hosting bundle
  * Maybe run `IISRESET` command will be required
* Web Platform Installer (WebPI)
* Web Deploy (MsDeploy) from WebPI

### Configure the server
* Execute `GenerateSigningCertificate.ps1 {ENVIRONMENT_NAME}` in Solution/Ridics.Authentication.Service, fill password, copy to deploy server e.g. into `C:\intehub\certs\`. Configure `IdentityServer` in `appsettings.{ENVIRONMENT_NAME}.json`
* Create new Application Pool in IIS
  * .NET CLR set to "No Managed Code"
  * In Advanced Settings change `Load User Profile` to `True` (required for storing loaded certificates)
* Deploy Authentication Service using steps from "Deployment" section
* Change used Application Pool to the one created in previous steps
* Create file `modules-autogenerated.xml` with content `<configuration></configuration>` in {AUTH_SERVICE_FOLDER}
  * Add permission for user IIS_IUSRS to write to this file
* Add `logs` folder to {AUTH_SERVICE_FOLDER}
  * Add permission for user IIS_IUSRS to write to this folder

### Deployment
* Run `DeleteObjBinFolders.ps1` script to allow perform a clean build (optional but recommended step).
* Build solution with command line script `BuildSolution.ps1 {ENVIRONMENT_NAME}`. Environment names are Development, Production, etc.
* Copy build artifacts from `build\Publish-{ENVIRONMENT_NAME}` to target server.
* Run database migration using `Ridics.Authentication.Database.Migrator\Migrate.ps1 {ENVIRONMENT_NAME}` to update database.
* Deploy Authentication service as **Admin** using `Deploy.AuthService.cmd`.

### The app configuration

This configuration can be performed in GUI after login:

* **It is required to change passwords for default users**
* Configure clients which can use this Authentication Service
  * Some values are preconfigured primarly for Development purposes
  * Remove all not valid clients
